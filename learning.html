    <p>
      I am learning to code right now, today we have covered HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and is one of the earliest programming languages of the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The HTML is used to describe the structure of the page while CSS and JavaScript are other languages that add style and interactivity.
